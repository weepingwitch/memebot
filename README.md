# memebot
a bot for generating tufts memes

live demo: http://willow.lol/tuftsmemes

right now you can either make a random meme, or a custom meme (by entering text and an image URL)

the random generation is still really shitty right now, but i hope to gradually improve it... it uses markov chain generation (trained on a source text) to generate the meme text, and picks from a series of pre-defined images for the meme image.
